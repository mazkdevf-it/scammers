## MajorHax#6017 - 880228359479635979

Accepted PayPal payments for https://keyauth.cc for a few months

Lied and said PayPal was on hold for several months, when we finally removed his account from Shoppy, he went ghost.

Had a friend reach out to him on https://cracked.io and he read the message, viewed his profile, and then changed his username thinking that would stop a scam report against him 🤣

he was banned, lost $100 forum subscription he bought, and a good chunk of the money was recovered as I instructed customers to chargeback him
